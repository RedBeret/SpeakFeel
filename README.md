# SpeakFeel - Emotional Vocabulary Growth

SpeakFeel is an interactive web app designed to help users expand their emotional vocabulary by connecting emotions to nuanced words and definitions. Through a simple emoji-based interface, users can explore different emotional states, learn related submoods, and gain a deeper understanding of how to express their feelings.

- **User Privacy**: No data is stored or shared â€” the app is completely private.
